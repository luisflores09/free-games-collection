Press this link to continue to the app [Free Games Collection](https://free-games-collection.herokuapp.com/)

You will need to sign in to add cames to your own collection.

## ***Future Enhancements***
Currently you can only add games to your favorite collection using a form, in the future I want to have the 'Add to Collection' button to add the games to your collection.

I want the show page to only display the selected game.
